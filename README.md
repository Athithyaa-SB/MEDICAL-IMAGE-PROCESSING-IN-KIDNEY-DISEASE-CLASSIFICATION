# MEDICAL-IMAGE-PROCESSING-IN-KIDNEY-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION
APPLICATION: Medical Imaging - Kidney Stone,Tumour,Cyst Detection 

OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this project is to develop an automated deep learning pipeline that 
classifies kidney conditions from medical images. The pipeline uses advanced image 
preprocessing techniques, including enhancement and degradation methods, to improve 
training robustness. The ultimate goal is to increase diagnostic accuracy and reliability of 
kidney disease classification models. 

INTRODUCTION 
Medical image analysis plays a crucial role in the early detection and classification of 
kidney-related conditions. However, inconsistencies in image quality caused by noise, low 
contrast, or blurring can hinder accurate interpretation and diagnosis.  
To overcome these challenges, this project presents a robust approach that: 
● Utilizes enhancement techniques to improve image clarity and detail. 
● Introduces degradation effects to evaluate model tolerance under poor-quality 
input. 
● Trains both custom and pre-trained deep learning models for classification. 
● Assesses the impact of preprocessing on the accuracy and reliability of disease 
prediction.
